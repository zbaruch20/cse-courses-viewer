# CSE Courses Viewer

## About

This is a Xamarin Forms application that streamlines the viewing of CSE courses at The Ohio State University, including their prerequisites and courses that they are a prerequisite for.

This application utilizes some web scraping and recursive-descent parsing techniques to obtain course information from the College of Engineering's [Directory of CSE Semester Courses](http://coe-portal.cse.ohio-state.edu/pdf-exports/CSE/).

## How to Install and Use

*WIP: I am still figuring out where to deploy the app. I'm thinking of using Azure, and I will update the readme when I finalize the deployment*
