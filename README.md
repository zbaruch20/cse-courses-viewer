# CSE Courses Viewer

## About

This is a Xamarin Forms application that streamlines the viewing of CSE courses at The Ohio State University, including their prerequisites and courses that they are a prerequisite for.

For now, the actual courses are simply hard-coded to test the application. Once the proof-of-concept is complete, I will use some web scraping and parsing techniques to parse course information from the College of Engineering's [Directory of CSE Semester Courses](http://coe-portal.cse.ohio-state.edu/pdf-exports/CSE/).

## How to Install and Use
